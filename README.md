## My Contrubutions
I played a key role in developing the Iced-Latte project by implementing core Java technologies, including Spring Boot, Spring Data, and Spring Security, to ensure a secure and efficient backend. I also integrated logging with Log4j2 and Slf4j and established thorough testing protocols using JUnit 5 and Rest Assured. This project was a collaborative effort, and I appreciate the invaluable support from my coworkers, whose insights greatly enhanced our platform's functionality and impact within the coffee community.
